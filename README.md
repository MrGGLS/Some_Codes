## calDate
In this program, I use some algorithms and create a class Date 
**What you can do?**  
1. Create a date object with a date
2. Use some functions and you will know the days between any two dates
 
This program can help you to caculate some works of Date
## music
This is a full assembly code. 

**An reminder**: you had better to compile it in emu8086 and then run music.exe in DosBox 

***Why?*** 

1. emu8086 can't control the speaker in you PC machine
2. You will get a lot of errors in DosBox ( if you use it to compile this program :) ) 

**A demo for this program**

### keys

2. **q/Q**: quit the program (only work when the series appears)
3. **others**: restart the program
