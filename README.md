## calDate
This program can help you to caculate some works of Date
## music
This is a full assembly code.
**An reminder**: you had better to compile it in emu8086 and then run music.exe in DosBox
***Why?***
1. emu8086 can't control the speaker in you PC machine
2. You will get a lot of errors in DosBox ( if you use it to compile this program :) )
**A demo for this program**
